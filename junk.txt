looking for suggestions (before building it myself):

I think that I want to write blogs and documentation in snippets, like Obsidian.

I think I want:
- to be able to git push the document(s) plus all of it pieces to github
- include SVG, PNG and MP3 with the text
- use an editor that auto-adjusts the font-size of text, like a slideshow editor (e.g. Apply Keynote) ; this acts as a wonderful reminder of "keeping things short" (point-form slides, instead of many pages of prose)
- view/follow links locally and on github
- open source.

I suspect that all of the above functionality is already available.

Is there a tool that binds all (most) of that together?

If not, what are the URLs/names/links for the pieces that would be needed?

-------

patent / product idea:

A chip that stores the current date/time plus a set of "events" (date/times that fire events) and survives power outages.

With a simple electronic API to set/get the date and for producing events.

OEM this chip to every appliance manufacturer (coffee maker, light timer, stove, etc.).

Standardize such that every appliance recovers after a power failure and can be programmed in the same way.  Currently, every appliance is programmed separately and differently.  (Obvious extension: program all appliances via wifi)
